<h2>Ten years in.</h2>
<p>
    Photography for me is about stealing moments to be remembered. My work isn’t really fine art,
    it is an exercise in being present. For many people I’ve met, staying present requires them to
    put their devices down. For me though, I’ve found that I’m most happy whenever I’ve found the
    courage to pick up my camera and capture the moment in front of me. The times I most regret
    are when I forgot my camera at home, or don’t have the courage or forethought to take the
    camera out of my backpack. I have lumped my work into three kinds of work: places, people, and
    instant film. I’m certainly not an expert or a master in any of these fields, but I’m proud of
    the way that I’ve grown in competency in each of these disciplines of photography. I’m not
    usually a person who struggles to step out and share my work with the world, but making this
    book has unearthed all sorts of resistance in my heart and mind around putting this work out
    into the world as a book. I had to fight through the idea that with this book I’m making a
    statement about my skill, competency, or vision with my work. More than anything, I simply
    love this work and am proud of it, and I wanted to honor and share the work with whomever
    would like to enjoy it, because it is deeply important to me. I hope that you feel something
    about the humanity represented inside of this book and that you know a bit more about my last
    10 years as a photographer. Putting this book together is an opportunity for me to look back
    at the work I’ve done and to crystallize it by putting it on paper. I hope that you enjoy and
    are moved by this decade’s work.
