                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                  I spend my days designing web and mobile apps, but an incredible part
                  of my time and energy is focused on being a better photographer. Learning the
                  fundamentals of photography took me a very long time before it clicked for me.
                  From that time, I have been driven to learn more and more about how to make great
                  images and how to tell small stories with those images. I am married to a
                  wonderful woman, Nicole, who never complains or shames me when I want to take
                  photos. For that, I am incredibly grateful.
                </p>
